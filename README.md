## Description

This project was built to enable employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. The goal was to create prompts that the user can select for password criteria and to generate a password based on the user's selction. 

I learned more about the applications and use of JavaScript. I heavily used `var`, `else` statements, and `for` loops wrapped in a `function`.

## Installation

No installation is required. See the following link to access the website: https://itsa-me-dea.github.io/03-Challenge/

## Usage

To use the site, click the "generate password" button and follow the prompts. If you do initally input a value or input a value outside of the specified range, click the button again to restart the process. 

For the following prompts, select which character types you'd like to include in your password with "OK", otherwise, select "Cancel."

Your password will be generated in input into the box. Highlight and use Ctrl+C to copy your password.
